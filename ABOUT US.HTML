    <p > Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
        Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.
    Indian cuisine reflects an 8,000-year history of various groups and cultures interacting with the Indian subcontinent, leading to diversity of flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India. Later, trade with British and Portuguese influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisin
        
    Were you one of those people who always knew what they wanted to be when they grew up? 

            I’m very jealous.
     a kid, I never had a very clear picture of what I wanted to do with my life. The only thing that sounded appealing was reading all day. But I didn’t want to be an editor. I just wanted to read and get paid for it…alas, that job still doesn’t exist. 
            
    <p> I grew up in a musical family, and I’ve always had a pleasant singing voice. I loved to perform, and figured I had as good a shot as making it as anyone else.  So like many other wide-eyed teens, I decided I would become a singer. 
            
            I enrolled in music school, but there was a problem — while I enjoyed performing, I didn’t particularly like practicing. And if you’re trying to get great at something competitive, you have to put in the hours. 
            
            I figured out pretty quickly that I didn’t have the heart for it. 
            
            While I waited for inspiration, I had to make a living. So I went to the #1 place for oddballs and outsiders, the place where everyone fits in: the restaurant industry. 
            
            It didn’t take too long to realize that I wouldn’t be a service industry “lifer.” Working FOH just wasn’t my cup of tea, although I did it for about eight years at bars, restaurants, and a catering company. 
            
            But I do love restaurant people. </p>
            
          <P> Eventually, I found myself working as executive assistant to a local restaurateur where I spent nearly five years on marketing, promotions, building community, and one heck of a construction project. 
            
            By early 2019, I was ready for my next challenge. So I began EDWC, a place where I could combine my love for the wonderful weirdos in hospitality with my word-nerd roots. 
            
            It took me a while to get here…but along the way I learned about the unique challenges that hospitality pros face. And now I use that knowledge to help you spread the word and connect with customers. 
            
            I’ve written for clients as close as up the street and as far as Saudi Arabia. And I’d love to work with you.
